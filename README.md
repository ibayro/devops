# Demo project description
This demo branch is a step-by-step guide to how I was coping with my first homework from the DevOps course, mentored by @denys_vasyliev on a Prometheus platform.

Here is a home task description:

Task: implement a web service in a local development environment 
(reproduce a practical task based on the lecturer's demonstration in the "Build, Ship, Run" coding session)

Goal: try yourself as a developer and operation engineer. Identify your strengths, tools, and topics of interest. 
Understand the level of difficulty of presenting the material and practical tasks.
Your task is to feel yourself in the role of a DevOps engineer and familiarize yourself with his typical tasks.

Here are some levels:
Basic (required) level:

         created main accounts in the systems and services listed in the coding session materials;
         configured working VSCode development environment;
         the initial code for the implementation of the practical task was created;
         the code is compiled and runs locally.

Advanced level:

         a container image is created using docker;
         the container starts successfully locally;
         the container image is uploaded to the docker hub.

Top-level:

         Kubernetes k3s version is installed;
         the container is running in Kubernetes;
         the service is working.
         
Homework was fully completed, and the top level was reached.
It took me almost 10 hours: 1 hour of preconditions and the rest was troubleshooting :)
