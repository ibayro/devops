## Week 3. Containers

In this section the following tasks will be done:

- [x] Create a container image from scratch
- [ ] Push the container to gcr.io and create a k8s cluster with a deployment of our container
- [ ] Create Makefile & Dockerfile  

### Practice
Task: Prepare code for cross-platform testing

#### Dockerfile: base image quay.io/projectquay/golang:1.20;
#### Makefile: clean should contain the removal of the newly created docker image rmi <IMAGE_TAG>.

Expected result: link to the source code of the Makefile and Dockerfile stored in the repository.
